Plugin Supports only Windows x64.

1) CONFIGURE STEAMVR TO RUN WITHOUT HMD

Edit: steamvr.vrsettings json file by adding the text between pipe symbols |"requireHmd" : false,| under steamvr.
This should look something like below.


"steamvr" : {
      "requireHmd" : false,
      ....
      ....
}


The File Location is something like below.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings

Start SteamVR with a tracker connected via USB and it should be seen.
If Connecting via Wireless Watchman Dongle, SteamVR->Devices->PairController should allow you to add the tracker after running.

2) AFTER ADDING PACKAGE TO UNITY, CREATE A TRACKER CALIBRATION

Run "Calibrate Tracker" from unity plugins folder.(running from windows explorer won't generate the cfg in the right location)
This will gernate a calibration with the 1st tracker position and rotation as the orgin of the world.
This is the first tracker in the steamvr list.
Sometimes it's easy to just calibrate with 1 tracker connected then add the others afterwards.
Aslong as the lighthouses do not move, this calibrated position and rotation will remain consistent.
The original tracker and additional trackers can then be moved reletive to this location when running.

3) TRACKING OBJECTS IN UNITY

Add "ViveTrackerObject" Unity Script to Objects you want to tie to trackers.
This Script converts the Tracker information which is a right handed coordinate system to Unity's Left Handed system.

The Tracker Index Defaults to 1 which should be consistently where a single tracker is indexed with SteamVR.
Additional Trackers Can be found on indicies 2-15.  This isn't always consistent but they are usually found on Indices 2-5.
Validity of Tracking Info can be checked as seen in the script update function.

Enjoy!
